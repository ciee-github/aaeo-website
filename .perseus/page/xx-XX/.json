{"state":{"about":"The Australasian Economics Olympiad is a collaborative outreach initiative that brings national high school Economics Olympiad winners from the Australasian region together in person, in Sydney. Participants compete individually on their knowledge of economics in Round 1, and in Round 2 country teams compete on their proposals to address a pressing economic policy question faced by all countries. Participants share their love of economics while also visiting major Australian economics institutions and engaging in a challenging and exciting competition. May the team that best wields the tools of economics win!\n","competition_html":"<p><em>The 2025 AAEO will happen from <strong>July 3-6</strong>.</em>\n<em>Previous competitions: <a href=\"/competition/2023\">2023</a> and <a href=\"/competition/2024\">2024</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>Part 1 (Individual – Economic Concepts and Analysis)</h2>\n<p>While in their home country, participants will respond to four extended response questions. This work will be submitted for grading and will contribute to students’ overall individual performance in the AAEO.</p>\n<p>The questions will require students to apply elements of economic theory and logic to current economic developments. Students will complete their responses via an online platform while supervised virtually by the AAEO organising committee.</p>\n<h2>Part 2 (Individual – Data and Quantitative Methods)</h2>\n<p><em>This component of the competition is new in 2024, and further details will be released later this year.</em></p>\n<p>After arriving in Sydney, participants will respond to extended response questions that provide an opportunity to demonstrate their mastery of quantitative aspects of economics, including phenomena such as statistical measurement, data handling, and econometric modelling.  Students will be asked to demonstrate their understanding of quantitative issues and tools in the context of real-world problems.</p>\n<h2>Part 3 (Team – Economic Policy Case Competition)</h2>\n<p>Each team representing its own country will be asked to create a presentation that sets out policy options to address an economic challenge in a country from the region. The presentations will be judged on their use of economic theory and logic, the clarity of their reasoning, and the quality of their explanations of how the proposed policy options may increase social welfare and may be evaluated in future against this goal.</p>\n<p>All participants will be informed of the policy area serving as the focus for the team round before they depart their home country. This will allow students to undertake some preliminary research before they commence the team round.</p>\n<h2>Awards</h2>\n<p>Three individual medals will be awarded to the top three performers in Part 1 and Part 2 of the competition. </p>\n<p>Three team medals will be awarded to the top three country team performers in Part 3 of the competition. </p>\n","contact_html":"<p>If your country is interested in joining the AAEO, or learning more, please contact our chief liason officer, <a href=\"mailto:J.Samuel@kingscollege.school.nz\">Jacob Samuel</a>.</p>\n<h3>Country Contact Details</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Australia: <a href=\"mailto:admin@aeo.org.au\">Australian Economics Olympiad</a></li>\n<li>New Zealand: <a href=\"mailto:J.Samuel@kingscollege.school.nz\">Mr. Jacob Samuel</a> and <a href=\"mailto:Neil.McMillan@acgedu.com\">Mr. Neil McMillan</a></li>\n<li>Singapore: <a href=\"mailto:demnph@gmail.com\">Mr. Desmond Handy</a></li>\n</ul>\n"},"head":"<title>Australasian Economics Olympiad</title>"}
