The Australasian Economics Olympiad is a collaborative outreach initiative that brings national high school Economics Olympiad winners from the Australasian region together in person, in Sydney. Participants compete individually on their knowledge of economics in Round 1, and in Round 2 country teams compete on their proposals to address a pressing economic policy question faced by all countries. Participants share their love of economics while also visiting major Australian economics institutions and engaging in a challenging and exciting competition. May the team that best wields the tools of economics win!
