On Friday night students and teachers enjoyed dinner together at a local restaurant in The Spot Randwick, a 15-minute walk from UNSW's Kensington campus. On Saturday and Sunday, students worked intensively in country teams on the case study on campus in state-of-the-art teaching and presentation rooms at UNSW Business School, with lunches and Saturday dinner provided on campus. On Sunday afternoon, each team presented their analysis and recommendations under strict time requirements to observers and a panel of judges (all professional economists). The Australian team won the Gold medal, the New Zealand team the Silver, and the Singapore team the Bronze.  Individual AAEO winners were also selected by the AEO organising team based on students' performance in the Round 1 essay examination component of the AAEO, with a Singaporean student earning the individual Gold medal, a New Zealand student taking the Silver, and an Australian student taking the Bronze.</p>\\n","year":2023}`;
